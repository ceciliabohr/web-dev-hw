1. System fonts are fonts that have already been downloaded to one's computer.
Web fonts are fonts that are available on the web, and can be easily accessed for
use, without downloading. Web-safe fonts are fonts that are most likely accessible on
most computers, like Arial and Times.

2. Having a fallback font is important in css so that if the preferred font is not
accessible by a certain computer, they can fallback onto the fallback font. Pun intended...

3. First, I google information about short stories, and found one I liked. Then, I
did my research and found when it was published and who was the original author. Then I
began creating a color scheme for my website, and started designing it from there. I
decided to go with an image background to spice up my site a little bit more. I am
proud of the website I created today!
