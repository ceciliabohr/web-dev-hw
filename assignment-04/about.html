      <p> Shel Silverstein was an American writer known for his children's
        <br />
        stories and cartoons. There have been over 20 million copies of
        <br />
        his work sold around the world. He also wrote children's songs,
        <br />
        and ended up winning two Grammys for his musical accomplishments.
        <br />
        I grew up reading his poetry books as a kid and have always loved reading
        <br />
        his work!
