      <h1>Snowball</h1>
        <h2>By Shel Silverstein</h2>
    <hr />
      <p>
        I made myself a snowball
        <br />
        As perfect as could be.
        <br />
        I thought I'd keep it as a pet
        <br />
        And let it sleep with me.
        <br />
        I made it some pajamas
        <br />
        And a pillow for its head.
        <br />
        Then last night it ran away
        <br />
        But first--it wet the bed.
