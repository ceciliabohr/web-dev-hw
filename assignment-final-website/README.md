#Assignment-Final-Website
##Cecilia Bohr

1. Everything I learned in this class was completely new to me! I had no idea
coding and we development had all of this happening on the back end. It feels really
good to understand how to do this and I definitely feel like it will be useful in
my future. I showed my final website off to my family and they were very impressed.
And when my family enjoys my work, I enjoy it even more! I loved this class.

2. Like I said before, the same goes for web design. I had no idea there were so many
details that went into creating websites! But it feels so liberating once you spend hours
on a website and then finally finish and get to see your final product.

3. For this website, I pieced together some html I had already written in previous
assignments, and added some new colors and photos and content so that this website could
be sort of a combination of all of my work this semester. I am so happy how it turned out!!!
