        <p>Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthtic
        eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. Historicaly, plants were treated as
        one of two kingdoms including all living things that were not animals,
        and all algae and fungi were treated as plants. However, all current
        definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi and some algae, as well as the
        prokaryotes. There are over 391,000 different place species in this
        world. Check out our website to see a few of them, and subscribe
