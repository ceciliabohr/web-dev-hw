Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
1. Id's are used for when you want to jump to a specific area of the webpage.
  Class attributes groups similar types of elements together by using
  the same name value. Divs are used to create structural clarity within a webpage.
  Spans are basically the inline equivalent of a div.

2. 'Alt text' is used for visually disabled people, and should be a description
  of the image.

3. My work cycle for this assignment was first finding my song and album cover and
Youtube video, etc. Then I went through the class website thoroughly because there
was a lot of content to gather for this assignment. Then I watched the walkthrough
and finished up my assignment! I think my website for this assignment worked out well.
