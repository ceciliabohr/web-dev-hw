# Assignment 06
## Cecilia Bohr

1. A form I come across all of the time is a "Login" form. Whenever I have to
login to any website that I am either subscribed to or pay to be apart of, I
usually have to login with my credentials (ie. username and password). Some
websites I have to login to include Facebook, Instagram, and Gmail.

2. Text is used when describing something that will only be using text, and text
that can be seen when typed (unlike passwords). Button input is used when something
that has been inputted into a website needs to be submitted.

3. It took me quite awhile to get my website to look how I wanted it to for this
particular assignment. I had a difficult time figuring out the table, but
eventually understood the process and successfully made a table. I also was so,
so happy when I eventually understood how to create an image button! I am very
happy with how it turned out.
