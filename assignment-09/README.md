1. One would use a universal selector type when wanting to apply a certain rule
to a variety of elements. An element selector type is used when someone wants to
target a certain type of element all at once, and apply a rule to them. A class
selector type is used when one wants to select elements that serve the same
function. ID selector types are similar to a class selector, yet they go even
further in defining which element needs what design, using the ID selector.
You might choose to use a universal selector type to create a rule for a large
group of elements, instead of using a more specific selector like element or class
or ID, which would take a much longer time.

2. I chose the colors blush pink, nude mauve, and black (and white). It gives off
a pastel vibe, while also being subtle and elegant.

Color 1: "light greyish red"
- HEX code: #E6C5C6
- RGB values: 230, 197, 198

Color 2: "greyish orange"
- HEX code: #C5B7AE
- RGB values: 197, 183, 174

Color 3: "black"
- HEX code: #O00000
- RGB values: 0, 0, 0

3. For this assignment, I first researched a decade that I loved, then I began
my research. I found a bunch of different looks from the 2010's and decided to
choose the minimalist route that a lot of people have expressed during this past
decade. I loved how my website turned out! It was difficult figuring out how the
css style sheet came together but once I finally figured it out I think I did a
pretty nice job! The decade is definitely reflected in the webpage I made.
