1. Date travels back and forth through the internet via packets. Packets
are sometimes divided up into parts so that they data can be transferred
more quickly. Using the internet address from where it started to where
it's going, the packet(s) travels and then arrives at its correct location.

2. IP addresses, otherwise known as Internet protocols, are how you
determine the location of the computer. They are an assortment of numbers.
The DNS, otherwise known as the Domain Name System, is something that
associates names of websites, with their IP addresses. So in order for
someone to find a website on the internet, they must know the website,
and then their computer will locate the IP Address and if they cannot, will
search other DNS to find it. Teamwork!

3. Cookies are messages that web servers pass to your own web browser
when you visit certain websites. They are harmless as they are not stored
in your computer, but just your browser. Sometimes, in order to use a
site to its full extent, cookies are essential.

4. The three main parts to a URL are:

- the protocol
- the domain name
- the path
