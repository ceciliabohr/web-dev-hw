The Internet is basically the network of machinery that allows us access to the Web. The Web is a subset of Internet traffic.   The Internet contains the Web, but the Web is not the Internet.
The Internet is made up of a huge network of specialized computers called routers. The internet works by sending and receiving packets, which contain information that you want to send/receive, through the network of routers to wherever the desired location is. A packet generally moves through multiple routers during its journey to its final destination. 
Directories are basically 'folders' that hold certain files on the internet. One file can be located in a directory, and that directory can be located in another directory, and so on. These are called 'paths' or 'directions'. Directories are hierarchical, therefore there is a root directory (the top of the directory tree). Whichever directory your are in is known as the 'active' directory, and any directories below the root directory are known as 'subdirectories'. Also, if there is a file inside of a directory, that file is known as the 'child' of that directory, and that directory is known as the 'parent' to that file. It works the same way with 'grandparent'. 
Using VCS is extremely beneficial because you can track every change you've made over time, 'revert back' to your previous modifications if something didn't go as planned for you, and you can share and collaborate easier with other people. It is beneficial to us students because you can take advantage of trial and error, and revert to older edits if necessary.
