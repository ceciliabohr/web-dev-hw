1. Learning HTML, I thought it was extremely interesting. I had no previous experience
learning about how websites were created, so it was amazing to finally learn! I thought that the hardest part about learning HTML was remembering the 4 main document elements and 4 main meta elements. They were complicated to memorize, so I had hard time remembering exactly how they were written. I thought that tables and divs were simple to learn, and they make such a big difference to the website itself! Overall, I have truly loved learning how to write HTML.

2. I am anxious to learn CSS as of right now, and that is because I feel like I am just getting comfortable learning HTML. I think that if I take it step by step I'll be able to stay on track, I am just nervous as of now....but excited, as usual!

3. First, I researched an instructable that was interesting to me. Once I found one, I went back and refreshed my memory on how to do the basics of HTML (the 4 main document and meta elements, divs, tables, lists, semantic and structural HTML, etc). Then I researched colors that would work well for the website, and chose a neutral scheme because coffee is brown. Then I sort of went from there and finished final touches!
