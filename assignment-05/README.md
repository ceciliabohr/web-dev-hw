1. There can only be one <head> and one <body>. The <head> acts as a container for
all metadata and is located between the <html> tag and <body> tag. It only shows up
on your text editor, and will not be publicly seen on your website. The <body> element
contains all content of an HTML document including hyperlinks, lists, tables, images
and text.
2. Structural markup is basically information about the structure of a document, while
semantic markup introduces presentational style to a document, including using things like
bold and italics.
3. I basically started this assignment by brushing up on my knowledge of HTML and reminding
myself of all the tags I've already learned so that I wouldn't struggle to remember certain
tags during the process of this assignment. I went through the entire website, then watched
the walkthrough and took it from there. I did go back and forth from my actual webpage
to my Atom app because I was very particular about making sure every step I finished was visually
correct on my webpage! I tried to make my photo of the recipe smaller but didn't have any luck.
