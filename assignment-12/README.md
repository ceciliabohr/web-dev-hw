1. My imaginary client was someone who wanted a website done for an animal
fostering company they started. They only have certain breeds, and wanted the
website to show that extensively. They wanted something modern and simplistic,
while also very neutral and minimalistic.

2. Inline is what makes an element become inline with horizontal state (but only as needed), ignoring the width properties. They flow with content on the screen really well. Inline-block is where the element expands horizontally to fill the parent-container, but
also the width, so the width properties are very necessary. Just inline is where
the element lines up with the other elements near.

3. First, I chose a fake client to make a website for, and found a bunch of stock
images and chose a color-scheme. Then I went on to finish everything making sure all
links worked, etc. I am very proud of my final website!!
